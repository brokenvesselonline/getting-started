        <h1>Getting started as a listener</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Hi Friend ðŸ¤—! <br><br>We are so glad to have you here with us.<br> To us, it's a party to have you share our vision for helping people<br><br>
          What you are starting however is not something we take lightly. <br>
          We are entrusting you with someone's emotional state so this message is a check of whether you are up for it 
        </h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">As a listener, it's important we understand you are fine. And as a result,
          <ul>
            <li>We shall once in a while invite you for a meet and greet just so that we spend time with you</li>
            <li>You shall be paired with in a group of five other listeners so that you watch over yourselves</li>
            <li>When you are not doing well, you shall temporary be relieved of your listener status so that you may heal, of which this time your listener group will be your source of comfort</li>
          </ul>

            We however want to know that you are still committed to what you signed up for.
            </p>

        <p><ul>
          <li>You will be assigned to a group amongst your fellow listeners, this group is meant to act as your support system if you need emotional suport.</li>
          <li>Every week you shall submit a report on the progress of your Vessel using this link</li>
          <li>In the event that you are not fine and you rather need someone to talk to yourself, the support group assigned to you is your first option... Otherwise reach out to any of our admins on the WhatsApp group and they shall respond accordingly</li>
        </ul></p>

          <li>Under no circumstances shall you share information between you and the Vessel, except only when discussing with the BV Core team about the Vessel's progress</li>
          <li>You are free to engage in more activities related to BV, and not limited to just your listener capacity</li>
          <li>Feel free to share ideas on how we can imporove</li>

        <p class="w3-text-grey"><span style="font-weight: bold"> PLEASE NOTE !!!</span><br>
            Whereas Broken Vessel is open to all persons of ethnicity and dominions, it was founded on biblical principals and we believe there is nothing that heals more like prayer does.
            We have a silent inhouse prayer team that is dedicated to praying for everyone who signs up as a Vessel. So as a listener, its your duty to share these prayer requests in your weekly report.
          </p>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">Please fill in the form below so that we get to know more about you, this helps us pair you with a person you will most likely be able to listen to</p>
